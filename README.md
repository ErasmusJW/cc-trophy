# The CC-Trophy

Hackathon trophy for the sad departure of CC.

This is a trophy that is definitely _*not_* designed to induce FOMO or attachment issues.
Rather, this is a tribute to 12 years dedicated to an ever evolving product; from FieldServer to SMC Cloud to FieldServer Grid Manager.

We connected the illuminated trophy to fieldpop.io so you'll always know when production is down -- which will hopefully only ever happen between 9 and 10 on a Tuesday morning! 

Hope you enjoy!
